All source .tex files are located in the \src directory.
All compiled .pdf files are located in the \pdf directory.
To compile any source .tex files into .pdf files, copy that file into the \Template directory, rename it to `capstone.tex`, and run the makefile. The compiled .pdf will be `capstone.pdf`.
